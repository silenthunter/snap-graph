SNAP: Small-world Network Analysis and Partitioning
version 0.2

SNAP (Small-world Network Analysis and Partitioning) is an extensible parallel
framework for exploratory analysis and partitioning of large-scale networks.

SNAP is implemented in C, uses POSIX threads and OpenMP primitives for
parallelization, and targets sequential, multicore, and symmetric multiprocessor
platforms. Our intent with SNAP is to provide a simple and intuitive interface
for network analysis and application design, hiding the parallel programming
complexity from the user. In addition to path-based, centrality, and community
identification queries on large-scale graphs, we support commonly-used
preprocessing kernels and quantitative measures that consider the global network
topology.

Please refer to the SNAP user's guide 
(http://snap-graph.sourceforge.net/snap_ug.pdf) for installation instructions.
